R5.6 Parameters and return values.  The difference between an argument and a return value is that an argument is passed
into a method, whereas a return value is the value returned from it.

You can have n number of arguments, whereas you can only have one return value. By varying either the number and/or type of arguments,
you change the method's signature, which means you may overload a method. Varying the return value only does not change the
method's signature and therefore does not qualify the method for overloading.

Since Java5, you can even specify a variable number of arguments aka varargs which looks something like this:
 private String[] someMethod(int nGrade, String... strNickNames) {//implementation};
Notice that the varargs parameter "String... strNickNames" must be listed last.  Calling this method would look something like this:
 String[] strReturnValues = someMethod(99, "Jim", "Jamie", "James", "Jamey", "Jimmy", "Jimbo");
